<H2>Float model? What's that?</H2>
<P>Okay, here is a simple test concerning how static elements interact with 
floats. According to the W3C specifications, when a floated element is directly 
followed by a static element (one that is normally flowed), then first, the 
float will be displayed against the left edge of the containing element (in this 
case the 'body' element), and then the static element will also display against 
that same edge, and at the same vertical height as the float. </P>
<P>The float should overlay the static element, unless the static element has a 
left margin that moves it out to the right, and out from behind the float. The 
static element might also be 'cleared' (clear:left or clear:both), which would 
put it below the level of the float. </P>
<H2>Details of the test</H2>
<P>The green bordered box (div#left) is floated left in the 'body', and is 
followed by div#static (purple box). If div#static had no width, then all modern 
browsers would display correctly, with the purple box overlaid by the green 
bordered box. </P>
<P>But, because div#static is <SPAN>width defined</SPAN>, browser variance is 
fully evident. That 'width' declaration makes 
<SPAN>Internet&nbsp;Explorer</SPAN> put div#static alongside the float as tho 
the float were part of the left body edge. <SPAN>Moz/N7</SPAN> and 
<SPAN>Op6/7.1</SPAN> do it according to the specs, with both boxes firmly pinned 
to the left body edge. </P>
<H2>Why this matters</H2>
<P>Making sophisticated use of float layouts sometimes requires stating the 
'widths' on some boxes, but doing so to a static box that follows a float makes 
IE display differently than any browser that dares to adhere to the standards. 
So differently in fact, as to make the situation impossible to ignore. (unless 
one happens to be *you&nbsp;know&nbsp;who*) </P>
<P>So the choice is to code only for IE, knowing the minority browsers will 
break, or avoid using the 'width' declaration in many cases, putting many types 
of layouts 'off&nbsp;limits'. Some choice. </P>
<H2>IE6 is not IE5.5</H2>
<P>The demo you see here is fully pixel defined, but usually a layout has the 
widths in percentages, at least for the elements following the float. When 
div#static is given a percentage width, IE5.5 looks at the available horizontal 
space alongside the float and says "That is now defined as 100% of the width". 
So if div#static gets 'width: 50%;', that div is half as wide as the space next 
to the float and starts next to the float as mentioned. </P>
<P>However, IE6 is different. Yes IE6 does start the div next to the float, but 
it does <EM>not</EM> take the float into consideration when figuring the width 
of div#static. Rather it uses the entire container as the 100% width refrence, 
just as the specs require. Yet it <EM>does</EM> start the div alongside the 
float! So the problem is only half-fixed in IE6, creating one more headache for 
us poor coders. </P>
<P>What does this mean? Well, if the div is given a width of 100%, it is as wide 
as the body element, and being placed next to the float it forces the right edge 
of the body element sideways by the width of the float, causing a scrollbar. 
<EM>But only in IE6!</EM> As if this mess weren't already bad enough. Oy. </P>
<H2>Close call in Norway</H2>
<P>There was recently a disturbing turn of events. <SPAN>Opera7</SPAN>, 
(released Jan-2003) was doing just what IE does; putting div#static next to the 
float, rather than having div#static ignore the float and start at the left 
viewport edge, as was done in Op6. </P>
<P>This seemed to be a 'cave-in' on the part of the Opera decision makers, to 
take the 'easy path', rather than stick to the specifications. Microsoft is 
indeed very influential, and apparently the float specifications were fast 
becoming a dead letter. </P>
<P>Happily Opera 7.1 (released April-2003) properly obeys the float 
specification. Whew! </P>
<P></P>
<H2>Last thoughts</H2>
<P>I am no purist, and could happily live with a specification designed by 
Microsoft, but to have MS publicly support the specs while silently flouting 
them really burns my toast. Is this how the future is made? </P>
<P>It's past time that these issues were aired out. Gentle reader, if you know 
any way of 'getting to' the movers and shakers at Microsoft, won't you please 
try and shake loose some kind of information regarding future plans? I dread 
having to tell the next newbie that the simple, straightfoward CSS standards 
can't simply be used 'as is', because the majority browser maker refuses to 
conform as it supposedly has agreed to do. This situation has got to end 
sometime; why can't it be now? </P><BR>
